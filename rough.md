BASH is an extremely useful programming environment (language?) that let's automate all kinds of tedious tasks. It's particularly good at interacting with the file-system and composing transformations on data streams. It's concise, kind of elegant, kind of gnarly, and definitely very weird syntax until you get the hang of it's design philosophy.

It's relatively easy to use but it's relatively hard to use well.

If you need to interact with the file-system and compose transformations on data streams you could use less convoluted language but you will quickly see that BASH has several advantages.
